\section{First looks -- EvoMos}
test a + \Sigma(a$_i$*p$_i$) correction, rmse as score
104/178 improve (58\%), with several halving the initial rmse and one reducing it to 17\% of original (2917, which started with 19.65)

in looking at parameters that provided improvement\\ 

should produce parameter (T-Td) for the regression to work on\\
n.b.: could also do as a binary tree genetic program\\
n.b.: not subject to singularity in mutually-correlated variables\\
0.25 sec, 1 processor for each full series\\
perfectly parallel\\

Retry with lognorm arg scaled by 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 --> best w. ~ 0.25\\

Seeding sd_best with 0.5 for the ones other than mean makes big improvement to number improved (only 7 are not)

Elitist 1+N gives improvement to all.
