C ABSTRACT: A DIURNAL CYCLE APPROXIMATION IS APPLIED TO PREVIOUSLY
C   COMPUTED RADIATIVE FLUXES AND HEATING RATES. FIRST,THE CURRENT
C   LOCAL-TIME VALUE (FOR THIS PARTICULAR MODEL TIME STEP) OF THE
C   COSINE SOLAR ZENITH ANGLE (COSZ) IS COMPUTED FOR ALL GAUSSIAN GRID
C   POINTS. SHORTWAVE (SW) HEATING RATES WHICH WERE COMPUTED WITH
C   LATITUDINAL MEAN COSZ IN THE SEPARATE RADIATION CALCULATION
C   ARE WEIGHTED BY THE RATIO OF ACTUAL TO MEAN COSZ (SEE MRF MODEL
C   DOCUMENTATION,1988,CHAPTER 3,'RADIATIVE PROCESSES',AUTHORED BY
C   K. CAMPANA,..). SURFACE SW FLUXES ARE ALSO COSZ WEIGHTED. SURFACE
C   LONGWAVE (LW) FLUX FROM THE ATMOSPHERE IS ALTERED EACH TIMESTEP
C   TO ACCOUNT FOR DIURNAL CHANGES OF MODEL TEMPERATURE IN THE LOWER
C   ATMOSPHERE. LW HEATING RATES FROM THE SEPARATE RADIATION
C   COMPUTATION ARE UNTOUCHED.
