C SUBPROGRAM:    TREAD       READS SIGMA LEVEL SPECTRAL COEFFICIENTS.
C   PRGMMR: JOSEPH SELA      ORG: W/NMC23    DATE: 88-04-27
C
C ABSTRACT: READS A COMPLETE SET OF SIGMA LEVEL SPECTRAL COEFFICIENTS
C   AT A SINGLE TIME TO BE USED TO START THE MODEL FORECAST.
C   THE SUBROUTINE COMPARES SI AND SL (THE MODEL'S VERTICAL
C   STRUCTURE) COMPUTED IN SETSIG WITH THE SI AND SL OF THE
C   INPUT COEFFICIENTS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THE COEFFICIENTS
C   WERE GENERATED UNDER THE SAME VERTICAL STRUCTURE.

C
C USAGE:    CALL TREAD (N,FHOUR,IDATE,GZ,Q,TE,DI,ZE,RQ,SL,SI,Z00)
C   INPUT ARGUMENT LIST:
C     N        - FORTRAN UNIT NUMBER FOR FILE CONTAINING THE
C                COMPLETE SET OF SIGMA LEVEL COEFFICIENTS.
C     SL       - SIGMA LAYERS     COMPUTED IN SETSIG.
C     SI       - SIGMA INTERFACES COMPUTED IN SETSIG.
C
C   OUTPUT ARGUMENT LIST:
C     FHOUR    - FORECAST HOUR OF THE SET OF COEFFICIENTS READ
C                FROM UNIT N.
C     IDATE    - IDATE(1)=INITIAL HOUR (GMT) OF FORECAST FROM
C                         WHICH COEFFICIENTS WERE MADE.
C                IDATE(2)=MONTH (1-12).
C                IDATE(3)=DAY OF THE MONTH.
C                IDATE(4)=YEAR OF THE CENTURY.
C     GZ       - LAPLACIAN OF TOPOGRAPHY.
C                GZ IS MULTIPLIED BY THE CONSTANT SNNP1 ARRAY.
C                GZ IS THEN MULTIPLIED BY THE GRAVITY CONSTANT AND
C                DIVIDED BY THE SQUARE OF THE RADIUS OF THE EARTH.
C     Q        - LN(PSFC)          COEFFICIENTS.
C     TE       - TEMPERATURE       COEFFICIENTS.
C     DI       - DIVERGENCE        COEFFICIENTS.
C     ZE       - VORTICITY         COEFFICIENTS.
C     RQ       - SPECIFIC HUMIDITY COEFFICIENTS.
C     Z00      - MEAN TOPOGRAPHY.
C                Z00 IS SET EQUAL TO GZ(1) AFTER GZ IS READ.
C
C   INPUT FILES:
C     UNIT N   - COMPLETE SET OF SIGMA LEVEL SPECTRAL COEFFICIENTS.
C
C   OUTPUT FILES:
C     OUTPUT   - PRINT FILE.
C
C ATTRIBUTES:
