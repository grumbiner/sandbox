C SUBPROGRAM:    TRIDI2      SOLVES TRIDIAGONAL MATRIX PROBLEMS.
C   PRGMMR: IREDELL          ORG: W/NMC23    DATE: 91-05-07
C
C ABSTRACT: THIS ROUTINE SOLVES MULTIPLE TRIDIAGONAL MATRIX PROBLEMS
C   WITH 2 RIGHT-HAND-SIDE AND SOLUTION VECTORS FOR EVERY MATRIX.
C   THE SOLUTIONS ARE FOUND BY ELIMINATING OFF-DIAGONAL COEFFICIENTS,
C   MARCHING FIRST FOREWARD THEN BACKWARD ALONG THE MATRIX DIAGONAL.
C   THE COMPUTATIONS ARE VECTORIZED AROUND THE NUMBER OF MATRICES.
C   NO CHECKS ARE MADE FOR ZEROES ON THE DIAGONAL OR SINGULARITY.

C USAGE:    CALL TRIDI2(L,N,CL,CM,CU,R1,R2,AU,A1,A2)
C
C   INPUT ARGUMENT LIST:
C     L        - INTEGER NUMBER OF TRIDIAGONAL MATRICES
C     N        - INTEGER ORDER OF THE MATRICES
C     CL       - REAL (L,2:N) LOWER DIAGONAL MATRIX ELEMENTS
C     CM       - REAL (L,N) MAIN DIAGONAL MATRIX ELEMENTS
C     CU       - REAL (L,N-1) UPPER DIAGONAL MATRIX ELEMENTS
C                (MAY BE EQUIVALENT TO AU IF NO LONGER NEEDED)
C     R1       - REAL (L,N) 1ST RIGHT-HAND-SIDE VECTOR ELEMENTS
C                (MAY BE EQUIVALENT TO A1 IF NO LONGER NEEDED)
C     R2       - REAL (L,N) 2ND RIGHT-HAND-SIDE VECTOR ELEMENTS
C                (MAY BE EQUIVALENT TO A2 IF NO LONGER NEEDED)
C
C   OUTPUT ARGUMENT LIST:
C     AU       - REAL (L,N-1) WORK ARRAY
C     A1       - REAL (L,N) 1ST SOLUTION VECTOR ELEMENTS
C     A2       - REAL (L,N) 2ND SOLUTION VECTOR ELEMENTS
C
C REMARKS: THIS ROUTINE CAN BE EASILY MODIFIED TO SOLVE A DIFFERENT
C   NUMBER OF RIGHT-HAND-SIDES AND SOLUTIONS PER MATRIX BESIDES 2.
