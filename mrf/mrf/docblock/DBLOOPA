C ABSTRACT:
C   PROGRAM  STARTS WITH SPECTRAL  COEFFICIENTS TEMP.
C   OF VORTICITY, DIVERGENCE, SPECIFIC HUMIDITY, AND
C   LN((PSFC).  CONVERTS THEM TO THE GAUSSIAN GRID AT EACH
C   LATITUDE AND CALLS FIDI,  FOR THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN
C   HEMISPHERES AT THE SAME TIME.  AFTER RETURN FROM FIDI
C   SR.  COMPLETES CALCULATION OF TENDENCIES OF TEMP. DIV. AND LNPS.
C   SPECIFIC HUMIDITY, AND VORTICITY ARE PREDICTED BY SR. SIGVOR
C   ALL INPUT/OUTPUT  IS VIA COMMONS.
