C SUBPROGRAM:    RMSGT       COMPUTES ROOT MEAN SQUARE.
C   PRGMMR: JOSEPH SELA      ORG: W/NMC23    DATE: 88-04-25
C
C ABSTRACT: COMPUTES THE ROOT MEAN SQUARE IN EACH LEVEL AND OF
C   THE VERTICAL INTEGRAL (WHEN APPROPRIATE) GIVEN THE SPECTRAL
C   COEFFICIENTS OF THE MODEL VARIABLES OR THE TENDENCIES.
C   THE RESULTS ARE PRINTED.  RMSGT IS STRICTLY DIAGNOSTIC.
