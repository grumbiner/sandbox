C SUBPROGRAM:    SOLAR       ASTRONOMICAL(SOLAR) DATA - SW RADIATION
C   PRGMMR: KENNETH CAMPANA  ORG: W/NMC23    DATE: 89-07-07
C
C ABSTRACT: THIS CODE WRITTEN AT GFDL ....
C   COMPUTES RADIUS VECTOR,DECLINATION AND RIGHT ASCENSION OF SUN,
C   AND EQUATION OF TIME. SAME AS SUBROUTINE -SOLMRF-, BUT
C   WITH HOUR ANGLE,FRACTIONAL DAYLIGHT,AND
C   MEAN ZENITH ANGLE CALCULATIONS REMOVED (SUBROUTINE -ZENITH-
C   CALCULATES THESE FOR EACH POINT RATHER THAN EACH LATITUDE).
C   --THIS CODE IS TO BE USED FOR OTHER FCST MODELS OR FOR THE MRF
C   --MODEL IF 'INSTANTANEOUS' SW CALCULATIONS DESIRED.
C
C PROGRAM HISTORY LOG:
C   77-07-21  ROBERT WHITE,GFDL.
C   89-07-07  KENNETH CAMPANA-MOVED THE HOUR ANGLE CALCULATIONS TO
C                              SUBROUTINE -ZENITH-
C
C USAGE:    CALL SOLMRF(JD,FJD,R,DLT,ALP,SLAG)
C   INPUT ARGUMENT LIST:
C     JD       - JULIAN DAY FOR CURRENT FCST HOUR.
C     FJD      - FRACTION OF THE JULIAN DAY.
C   OUTPUT ARGUMENT LIST:
C     R        - RADIUS VECTOR OF THE SUN.
C     DLT      - DECLINATION OF THE SUN (RADIANS).
C     ALP      - RIGHT ASCENSION OF THE SUN.
C     SLAG     - EQUATION OF TIME (RADIANS).
