                           PROGRAMS and SCRIPTS

   In this directory are source code and scripts that were used by 
NARR.  The files are intended for informational purposes only.  There 
is absolutely NO support for these codes.   If you try to compile them 
and you are missing a library or a subroutine, too bad.  If you have 
a question about porting the code, too bad.  If you want to run a 
regional model, I suggest that you look elsewhere.


   The files in this directory are intended for people with technical 
questions and who are willing to dig through the source code.
